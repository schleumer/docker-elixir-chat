I'm trying to figure how to map ports on EBS, at this moment I have no idea how to do this. So I moved my demo to Digital Ocean(using Docker).

Also, there's a WebSocket problem when client requests are passing through proxies, then I made WebSocket requests go through port 8181, which I have no idea how to make it work on EBS.

# Hellow

To start your Phoenix app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/deployment).
